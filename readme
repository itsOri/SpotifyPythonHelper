Hello!
this script should help u manage spotify playlists with python3.
it has 3 options -
* copy all songs from a playlist to one of your playlists (or to a new one)
* take all liked songs and export them to a playlist
* remove duplicates from a playlist

the script requires setting a new account here for getting id and secret - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/
you should also add your spotify user in there and allow redirect to google (put the same url as in the script).
if u want to change the script u may find this  useful  - https://github.com/plamere/spotipy
theres alot of examples

Enjoy!!
